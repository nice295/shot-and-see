## What should I do with Parse

1. Install Parse SDK in my Yun

2. Write code to send a picture to my Parse collection
   - Make a new collect named "Events"
   - "Events" collection should include the below columns
     - Picture (File)
      - Etc.

3. Restrictions
   - The total counts of rows should be limited because we wants to use Parse as free.
   - Let's make the max row as 10.

4. Push notification
   - Check the ability of send notification from Client
     - Yun should send the notification with a specific channel name
